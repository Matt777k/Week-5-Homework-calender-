# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

Hello,

This is an web application designed as a scheduling calender for a typical 9 to 5 work day.

Scrolling down presents time blocks of standard business hours (9am-5pm).
Each hour is broken into 1 hour blocks.

Each hour block is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
Grey represent an hour block that has passed, red represents the present time, and green represents future hour blocks.

Type an event into any hour block and click the lock icon to save.
The event will persist even through page refresh.

Thank you,

Matthew Kerr
